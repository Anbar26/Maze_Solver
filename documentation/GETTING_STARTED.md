## Step 1: Pick an Algorithm

Click one of the three buttons:
- **Q-Learning** - Recommended for beginners
- **SARSA** - Try if Q-Learning doesn't work well
- **Monte Carlo** - For experiments

The app automatically sets good parameters for you!

## Step 2: Start Training

1. Click the ▶️ (Play) button
2. Watch the progress bar and logs
3. Wait for training to complete (1-30 seconds)
4. You'll see "Training completed!"

## Step 3: Watch Your Agent

1. Click "Simulate Policy" button
2. Watch the blue dot navigate the maze
3. Success = Rainbow celebration! 🎉
4. Failure = Red warning with helpful tips

## Step 4: Try Different Mazes

Click the 🔀 (Shuffle) button to generate new mazes.

The app creates mazes of different difficulties:
- **Easy:** Short paths, many shortcuts
- **Medium:** Balanced challenge
- **Hard:** Long winding paths

## Common Issues

### Agent hits walls?
- Increase episodes to 2000
- Make sure gamma is 0.99
- Try Q-Learning algorithm

### Training too slow?
- Reduce episodes to 500
- Use Q-Learning (fastest)
- Avoid Monte Carlo for quick results

### Want to create your own maze?
1. Click "Edit Mode"
2. Use tools to draw walls/paths
3. Click "Save" when done
4. Train on your custom maze!

## Tips

✅ Start with default settings
✅ Use Q-Learning for most mazes  
✅ Higher episodes = better learning (but slower)
✅ Try different mazes to test your agent
✅ Check "Detailed Report" to see how it learned
